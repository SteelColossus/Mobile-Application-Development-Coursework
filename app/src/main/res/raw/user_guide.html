        <h1>User Guide</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            MyShoppingList is an app that allows you to add and track all of your shopping lists
            easier, taking the hassle out of trips to the supermarket.
            Better yet, the products come directly from Tescoâ„¢, so you can pick out exactly what you
            will be buying later!
        </p>
        <h3>Adding a new shopping list</h3>
        <p>
            When on the initial screen, press the add button
            <img
                    src="file:///android_res/raw/add_button.png"
                    alt="Add Button"
                    class="add-button action-image">
            to add a new shopping list.
            A dialog will pop up where you can give your new shopping list a distinct name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then you can add items to your new shopping list.
            Press the add button
            <img
                    src="file:///android_res/raw/add_button.png"
                    alt="Add Button"
                    class="add-button action-image">
            to add a new item.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this screen, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search for any product you like by typing in the search bar at the top.
                When you press search, a list of the most relevant results for that query will come
                up.
            </li>
            <li>If you'd like, you can perform a voice search by pressing the voice search icon
                <img
                        src="file:///android_res/raw/voice_search.png"
                        alt="Voice Search"
                        class="voice-search action-image">
                on the toolbar.
            </li>
            <li>You also have the option of scanning a product barcode by pressing the three dots in
                the top right-hand corner and selecting "Scan".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you have found a product you would like to add to your shopping list, you can add it by
            pressing on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After adding an item to your shopping list, you have more options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can remove an item by holding down on it and selecting "Remove".</li>
            <li>Similarly, if you want a slightly different product than the one you chose, you can
                hold down on it and select "Change item".
                This changes the item in the list to the new one you select.
            </li>
            <li>You can add any more items to your shopping list by pressing the add button
                <img
                        src="file:///android_res/raw/add_button.png"
                        alt="Add Button"
                        class="add-button action-image">.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can view the total price of your shopping list so far in the bottom left hand corner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, you can complete your shopping list by pressing the finish button
            <img
                    src="file:///android_res/raw/finish_button.png"
                    alt="Add Button"
                    class="finish-button action-image">.
        </p>
        <h3>Editing an existing shopping list</h3>
        <p>
            Now on the front page, you should be able to see the shopping lists that you have added.
            Press on one of them to edit it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Editing a shopping list allows you to do exactly the same things as adding a new one -
            you can remove items, change items and add new items if you've forgotten any.
            Additionally, you can tap on an item to cross it off, indicating that you have now
            bought it.
            Tapping it again will uncross it off.
        </p>
        <p>
            To save your changes to the shopping list, press the finish button
            <img
                    src="file:///android_res/raw/finish_button.png"
                    alt="Add Button"
                    class="finish-button action-image">.
            If you want to discard your changes, you can press back.
            A dialog will pop up asking if you want to save the current shopping list.
            Pressing no will discard all the changes you have made.
